### CS 7641 Project 2: Randomized Optimization

# Github Link:
https://github.com/jles9/CS7641_RandomizedOptimization.git

## Overview
This project seeks to conduct a suvery of randomized optimization algorithims, including:
    Randomized Hill Climbing
    Simulated annealing
    Genetic Algorithims
    MIMIC

The survery is conducted with respect to three different problems, which will be:
  Four Peaks
  Flip Flop
  Knapsack


## Run instructions
    Ensure sklearn, pandas, np, mlrose-hiive, and matplotlib are installed.  

    run command:
    python3 ./runExp.py

    This will run all experiments, including all optimization problems 
    Individual experiments may be omitted by commenting them out in runRandomOptExp() function

    Results will automatically be saved to results/ and graphs will be saved to /graphs



## Files Included

    runExp.py : main entry point

    <Problem>Opt.py : respective file to run all algo experiments for a particular problem

    NNAgent.py : File to fun NN Opt experiment

    Several other problem files were included, but will not be part of the report
